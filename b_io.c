* Project: Assignment 5 â€“ Buffered I/O
*
* File: b_io.c
*
* Description: This project handles a buffered IO.
  This c file code handles the buffering.
  The b_open returns a integer file descriptor.
  The b_read takes a file descriptor, 
  a buffer and the number of bytes desired.

  The main program (buffer-main.o, provided) uses the 
  command line arguments to specify data file and 
  the desired target file(s). The main program uses 
  b_open, reads some variable number of characters at a time 
  from the file using b_read, prints those characters 
  to the screen (ending in a newline character), 
  and loops until it has read the entire file, 
  then b_close the file and exit. 
  The program may open multiple files at one time and 
  will request on chunk and print that one for each file, 
  so the output will contain a line from file 1 
  than a line from file 2, etc until the end of file.
